The gadget consists of six glasses of soda of different "flavors" packaged in a carrier. When the user drinks one entire glass, the bioelectric energy in the carbonic acid of the soda will spur the brain of the user to do the action of the corresponding flavor. For example, Success Soda will lead to the user succeeding in whatever he does. However, a trip to the toilet will undo the effects of the soda.
