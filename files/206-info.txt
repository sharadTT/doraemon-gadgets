The item is a light piece of consumable (enough to be launched for a significant distance with a slingshot) that temporarily adjusts the user&#39;s voice and greatly improves its quality, though this often results in its pitch being increased. The effect instantly applies once it enters the user&#39;s throat, though it wears off after some time.
