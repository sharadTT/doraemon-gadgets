First a user must tell what problems he/she want to solve and then he/she will go inside the door. To solve his/her issue, an instructor who resides inside the door will give him/her difficult tasks to reach his/her goal. The time inside the door is slower than the real world. The user cannot go back to the real world unless he/she reaches his/her main goal.
