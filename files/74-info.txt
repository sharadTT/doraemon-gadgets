Users have to put their hands in the gas that comes out and it will make gloves out of the hands. They have to do something with the gloves, quickly wear them off and the gloves will continue to do the thing the user wants to do. If users do not use the Cancellation Spray to remove the gloves the gloves will keep on doing the same thing forever.
