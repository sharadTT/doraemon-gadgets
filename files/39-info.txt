The whole Spy Set looks like a head of a robot with one eye and a left ear. The 'head' has an antenna, which receives transmissions from the eye and ear. Both eye and ear are detachable, and can levitate around. They are small enough to slip into a person's house. The 'mouth of the head' can be opened and functions as the monitor.
