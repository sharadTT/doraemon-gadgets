The whole Spy Set looks like a head of a robot with one eye and a left ear. The &#39;head&#39; has an antenna, which receives transmissions from the eye and ear. Both eye and ear are detachable, and can levitate around. They are small enough to slip into a person&#39;s house. The &#39;mouth of the head&#39; can be opened and functions as the monitor.
